# Web5 Claims - ZK Language Learning Certificate Verifier

A zero-knowledge verifiable credential system for language learning achievements, built for ZK Hack Berlin.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Web5 Claims is a privacy-preserving certificate verification system designed for language learning applications. Our system allows learners to prove their language proficiency without revealing personal information, using zero-knowledge proofs to maintain privacy while ensuring credential authenticity.

## 🏆 Hackathon Tracks

This project targets multiple ZK Hack Berlin prize tracks:

- **🥇 ZK Hack Berlin Winners** - Main competition
- **🔐 ZKPassport - Private Identity Verification** - Privacy-focused credential verification
- **⚡ Arbitrum - Build a ZK Verifier in Rust for Stylus** - Rust-based ZK verification
- **👥 Xion - Consumer ZK Apps** - User-friendly ZK applications

## 💡 The Problem

Traditional language learning certificates reveal too much personal information:
- Full identity exposure when proving qualifications
- Centralized verification systems prone to fraud
- No granular privacy controls (prove specific skills without revealing entire transcript)
- Employers and institutions require trust in issuing authorities

## 🚀 Our Solution

Web5 Claims provides:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Prove language proficiency without revealing identity
2. **Granular Claims**: Verify specific skills (e.g., "speaks Spanish at B2 level") without full transcript
3. **Decentralized Trust**: Blockchain-based verification removes need for centralized authorities
4. **Privacy by Design**: Learners control what information to share and with whom

### Core Components

- **Credential Issuer**: Language learning platforms issue verifiable credentials
- **ZK Proof Generator**: Converts credentials into zero-knowledge proofs
- **Rust Verifier**: Efficient verification system built in Rust
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular permission system for claim sharing

## 🎓 Use Cases

### For Learners
- Prove language skills for job applications without revealing full educational history
- Demonstrate specific competencies (listening, speaking, writing) independently
- Maintain privacy while building verifiable skill portfolio

### For Employers
- Verify candidate qualifications without accessing personal data
- Trust in skill verification without relying on specific institutions
- Streamlined verification process

### For Educational Institutions
- Issue tamper-proof digital certificates
- Reduce administrative overhead for verification requests
- Enable students to selectively share achievements

## 🔧 Development Setup

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run the verifier
cargo run
```
